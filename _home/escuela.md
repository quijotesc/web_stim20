## The School

This school was born with two main objectives:

### Happy Students

It is very important for us that each person reaches his/her objectives by the end of the course. The experience should be rewarding in every way: cultural, educational and especially at a personal level.

### Happy Teachers

We are people who enjoy teaching Spanish and get involved in the long-term project. All the important decisions to ensure the schoolâ€™s growth are discussed and decided as a team: the course content and fees, salaries, new hires, etc. We created this School as a tool to unite the efforts of various different autonomous teachers, in order to provide a better learning and quality service and improve performance by not focusing on finding new students.
