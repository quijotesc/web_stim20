## The School

#### The teachers

We want people who enjoy teaching Spanish and get involved in the long-term project. All the important decisions to ensure the schoolâ€™s growth are discussed and decided as a team.

STiM specialises in teaching Spanish as a foreign language and our greatest asset is our teachers. The academic team consists of native Spanish speakers, with extensive experience in teaching Spanish, who have received specific training. We try to keep up-to-date with a view to providing a dynamic, fun and effective programme.
