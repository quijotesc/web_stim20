# STIM web

The website it's super simple an flexible for evolution, uses jekyll and gh pages with almost no client side scripting, zero database. It embraces github as a collaboration platform

For localhosting, you can clone it and after installing ruby and jekyll you should be able to jekyll serve or jekyll build

builds will be saved at _site, all the styles will be located at _sass, there is no javascript yet and we are not usign any jekyll plugins.

keep it simple
