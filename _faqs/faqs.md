## Our School

### How big is the school?

STiM is a small Spanish school newly formed, so we can not estimate the number of students we will have in each season. This does not mean we are not experienced in teaching Spanish. Our teachers have extensive experience working autonomously and for other organizations.  

## Registration

### When should I enrol on a course?

As long as there’s availability, we accept last-minute enrolments, that is, up until the Friday prior to the start of the course.

Do I have to pay in advance to reserve a place on the course?

If you want to book a place you will have to put down a deposit of 100% of the course fees by means of a bank transfer, in cash or credit card directly at the school.

Puedes realizar el pago de las siguientes formas:

- Mediante una transferencia bancaria

### I don't speak a word of Spanish, how can I enroll?

Until you feel comfortable speaking in Spanish, we will make sure we can understand each other. There are people on our team who speak several languages and we are happy to adapt to your needs.
Have in mind that you will speak Spanish from the first day, even as a complete beginner. Our Spanish classes are highly communicative and you will be surprised at how fast you learn the language.
Many of our students are complete beginners, but they start to speak Spanish very quickly.

## Our courses

### How long does the class last?

60 minutes. Many schools talk about one-hour classes, but that doesn’t mean that they last for one full hour. When we talk one hour we mean a full 60 minutes, not a 45 or 50 minute class.

### Do I get a certificate at the end of my course?

All students get a certificate of attendance (by attending at least 80% of course lessons) and a level certificate at the end of the course. We should make clear that the only certificates that are official are those issued by Instituto Cervantes after taking the DELE exam.

## Accommodation

### What kind of accommodation do you offer?

We will be happy to help you throughout the process of searching for accommodation, but the school is merely an intermediary between students and local companies that we have selected in Malaga. In the case of hotels, hostels or shared flats, the school can only provide information and mediation.

## Cultural program

### What kind of activities do you offer in the cultural program?

Every Monday there is a presentation of the cultural program, which includes activities organized by the school and also activities organized by our partners. We will also provide information on which ones are included in the course and which ones have an additional cost.

The school organizes several activities outside the class schedule: screening of films in Spanish, get-togethers in bars close to the school with the teachers, weekend trips, nature trails, flamenco courses etc.
Every week there are activities organized by our partners. These activities are in the afternoon, after school and include language exchanges, Ultimate Frisbee training, etc.

The school organizes guided tours of different areas of Malaga, with a view to getting to know the museums, monuments, etc. of Malaga and its alternative culture (street art, live music, etc).
